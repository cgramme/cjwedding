                    <div class="profile-image-small"></div>
                    <p>Nine years ago, our world changed when we met at work. For me, it was all over when I met Chris. Iâ€™ll never forget the first moment I saw him. He was kind and funny, two traits that really set him apart. A few months later we started dating and recently celebrated our 8 year anniversary in November.</p>
